# Introduction
---

The Buggy Web Application (BWAPP) offers a set of challenges, which contains tasks based on the ***IDOR vulnerability*** (CVE )

***SECURITY LEVELS COVERED***
- Low
- Medium
# Target

# Functionality
---

The application reflects text passed through the `message` parameter:

# Exploitation
---

Testing a PoC PHP injection payload:

``` PHP
?message=lol; echo "Hacked!"
```

![[images/images/PhpiPoc.png]]

The application is vulnerable to PHP code injection!

Using PHP `system()` based payloads it is possible to execute commands reading sensitive files and performing other actions on the server.

## Payload

``` PHP
?message=lol; system("ls -la")
```

This will list all files in the current directory with their permissions:
