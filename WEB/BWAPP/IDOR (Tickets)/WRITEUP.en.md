# Introduction
---
The Buggy Web Application (BWAPP) offers a set of challenges, which contains tasks based on the ***IDOR vulnerability*** (CVE )

***SECURITY LEVELS COVERED***
- Low
- Medium
# Target
---

![[images/IdorTicketsTarget.png]]

# Functionality
---

The application allows to place an order:

# Exploitation (Low security level)
---

The application passes `ticket_quantity` and `ticket_price` parameters, which can be easily modified to an absurd condition ^^:

# Exploitation (Meduim securtiy level)
---

On the medium security level, the `ticket_price` parameter is likely hard-coded, and not passed via http:

Although it is still possible to trick the application by adding the missing parameter to the request with the desired value (the I symbol added by accident to the `order` value):
