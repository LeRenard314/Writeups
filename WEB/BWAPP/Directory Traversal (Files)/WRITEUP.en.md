# Introduction
---

The Buggy Web Application (BWAPP) offers a set of challenges dedicated to the ***Directory Traversal Vulnerability*** (***CVE-2004-2687***)

***SECURITY LEVELS COVERED***
- Low
- Medium
# Target

# Exploitation (Low security level)
---

A basic Poc Directory Traversal payload revealed the contents of the `etc/passwd` (reading of `etc/group` is also possible) file:

# Exploitation (Medium security level)
---

On higher security levels, the standard payload techniques end up being detected:

Using a large set of payloads, it is possible to bypass the regulations and exploit the vulnerability. What's funny is that the first list entry (`/etc/passwd`) resulted in a succeful attack:

It is worth noting that the fuzzing attack revealed other existing files (`/etc/shadow`, `etc/proc/self/envriron`), which exist yet cannot be acessed likely because of user priveleges:
